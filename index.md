# Little Backup Box

Little Backup Box is an application that transforms a Raspberry Pi (or any single-board computer running a Debian-based Linux distribution) into an inexpensive, fully-automatic, pocketable photo backup device.

## Little Backup Box features

- Back up the contents of a storage card to an external USB storage device. Little Backup Box supports practically any USB card reader, and, by extension, any card format.
- Transfer photos and RAW files directly from a camera to an external USB storage device. If your camera is supported by gPhoto2 software, it will work with Little Backup Box.
- Use multiple cards. Little Backup Box assigns a unique ID to each card and create a separate folder for each card on the backup storage device.
- Perform card backup fully automatically with no user interaction.
- Start specific backup operations manually using Little Backup Box's web UI.
- Automatically generate a minimalist responsive gallery from the backed up RAW files.
- Stream the backed up photos to any DLNA-compatible client.
- Access the backed up content from other machines on the network.
- Push backed up contents to a cloud storage service.

## Installation

1. Create a bootable SD card with the latest version of Raspbian Lite for use with Little Backup Box.
2. Make sure that your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet.
3. Run the following command on the Raspberry Pi: `curl -sSL https://is.gd/littlebackupbox | bash`

Little Backup Box supports three backup modes:

- **Card backup** Automatically backs up the contents of a storage card to an external storage device.
- **Camera backup** Transfers photos, RAW files, and videos from the camera connected directly to the Raspberry Pi. The transferred files are saved in the _/home/pi/BACKUP/[CAMERA MODEL]_ directory on the system storage card. **Important** Make sure that the camera is set to the MTP USB connection mode.
- **Internal backup** Automatically backs up the contents of a storage card to the internal storage.

During the installation, choose the desired mode from the selection dialog.

When prompted, reboot the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

The exact steps depend on the backup mode.

### Remote control mode

The remote control mode is enabled by default. This mode allows you to control and manage Little Backup Box via a web UI. 

1. Point the browser to _http://127.0.0.1:8000_ (replace _127.0.0.1_ with the actual IP address of the Raspberry Pi).
2. Start the desired action by pressing the appropriate button.

- Press the **SYSTEM INFO** icon to access basic system information, such as a list of storage devices and memory usage.
- To view JPEG files on the backup storage device, click the  **RAW VIEWER** icon.
- To edit the configuration file, click the **SETTINGS** icon.

### Card backup mode

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Plug in a backup storage device.
3. Insert a storage card into a card reader and plug it into the Raspberry Pi.
4. Wait till the Raspberry Pi shuts down.

**Note:** To differentiate between different storage cards, the backup script creates a datetime-based *.id* file in the root of each storage card. The name of the *.id* file is also used as the destination backup folder on the storage device.

### Camera backup mode

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi.
3. Turn the camera on.
4. Wait till the Raspberry Pi shuts down.

### Internal backup mode

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Insert a storage card into a card reader and plug it into the Raspberry Pi.
3. Wait till the Raspberry Pi shuts down.
